# Learn how to reverse a c/c++ binary under 30 min

In this class, we will introduce how to revese a binary and trace
the flow to cat the key in the binary.

## How to Play
You can run *make* and get several binaries. Each binary need you to
get the access key to own this game (you can see *pwn!* to ensure you
pass the test.)

If you want to directly see the solution, you can directly analysis
the source code and there are some description in here.

## Scenraio 1
Run the binary and try to get the access key. It should as simple
as you expect.

HINT: NOP
